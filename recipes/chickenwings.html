    <h2>EXTRA CRISPY CHICKEN WINGS THAT WILL BE A HIT AT YOUR NEXT PARTY!</h2>
    <p>It took me some time to create the recipe I am sharing today. If you want a chicken wing that will give you that initial fried chicken crunch, with a moist and meaty afterbite, then read on below.</p>
    <p>These wings are a hit at every party, BBQ, or game day I go to and are always the number one requested dish that I make. The key lies in one major factor, <stron>twice fried</strong>.</p>

        <li>In a seperate bowl mix your Buffalo Wing Sauce, BBQ sauce, and Honey and whisk</li>
        <li>Dust in each chicken wing in the flour and place in basket</li>
        <li>Once the basket is full, lower into preheated oil.</li>
        <li>Cook each wing for approximately 10 minutes or until the skin is a dark golden brown.</li>
        <li>Transport chicken wings on cooling rack. Repeat until all chicken wings are cooked.</li>
        <li>Once all wings are fried repeat the process a second time.</li>
